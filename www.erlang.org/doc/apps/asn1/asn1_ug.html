  <h3><a name="id2253684">1.1 
        Introduction</a></h3>
    
    <h4>Features</h4>
      
      <p>The Asn1 application provides:
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An ASN.1 compiler for Erlang, which generates encode and
         decode functions to be used by Erlang programs sending and
         receiving ASN.1 specified data.</li>
        <li>Run-time functions used by the generated code.</li>
        <li>Encoding rules supported are <strong>BER</strong>, the
        specialized BER version <strong>DER</strong> and the basic form of
        aligned and unaligned variants of <strong>PER</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h4>Overview</h4>
      
      <p>ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation 1) defines the abstract
        syntax of information. The purpose of ASN.1 is to have
        a platform independent language to express types   using a
        standardized set of rules  for the transformation of values of
        a defined type, into a stream of bytes. This stream of bytes
        can then be sent on a communication channel set  up by the
        lower layers in the stack of communication protocols e.g.
        TCP/IP or encapsulated within UDP packets. This way, two
        different applications written in two completely different
        programming languages running on different computers with
        different internal representation of data can exchange
        instances of structured data types  (instead of exchanging
        bytes or bits). This makes programming faster and easier since no code
        has to be written to process  the transport format of the
        data. 
        </p>
      <p>To write a network application which processes ASN.1 encoded
        messages, it is prudent and sometimes essential to have a set
        of off-line development tools such as an ASN.1 compiler which
        can generate the encode and decode logic for the specific ASN.1
        data types. It is also necessary to combine this with some
        general language-specific runtime support for ASN.1 encoding and
        decoding. 
        </p>
      <p>The ASN.1 compiler must be directed towards a target language
        or a set  of closely related languages. This manual describes a
        compiler which is directed towards the functional language
        Erlang. In order to use this  compiler, familiarity with the
        language Erlang is essential. Therefore, the runtime support for ASN.1 is
        also closely related to the language Erlang and
        consist of a number of functions, which the
        compiler uses. The types in ASN.1 and how to represent
        values of those types in Erlang are described in this manual.
        </p>
      <p>The following document is structured so that the first part describes 
        how to use ASN.1 compiler, and then there are descriptions of all
        the primitive and constructed ASN.1 types and their representation
        in Erlang,
        </p>
    
    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
      
      <p>It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the ASN.1 notation
        as documented in the standard definition [X.680] which is
        the primary text. It may also be helpful, but not necessary,
        to read the standard definitions 
        [X.681] [X.682]  [X.683]
        [X.690] [X.691]. </p>
      <p>A very good book explaining those reference texts is 
        [DUBUISSON], free to download at 
        <span class="bold_code">
<a href="http://www.oss.com/asn1/dubuisson.html">http://www.oss.com/asn1/dubuisson.html </a></span>.
        </p>
      <p>Knowledge of Erlang programming is also essential and reading the book 
        <strong>Concurrent Programming in ERLANG</strong>,
        [erlbook2], is recommended. Part 1 of this is available on the web in 
        <span class="bold_code">
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/download/erlang-book-part1.pdf">PDF</a></span> format.
        </p>
    
    <h4>Capability</h4>
      
      <p>This application covers all features of ASN.1 up to the 1997
      edition of the specification. In the 2002 edition some new
      extensions came up of which there are support only for some of
      them. ECN (Cncoding Control Notation) and XML notation are still
      unsupported. Though, the other features of 2002 edition are
      fully or partly supported as shown below:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>Decimal notation (e.g., "1.5e3") for REAL values. The
	  NR1, NR2 and NR3 formats as explained in ISO6093 are
	  supported.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>The RELATIVE-OID type for relative object identifiers are
	  fully supported.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>The subtype constraint (CONTAINING/ENCODED BY) to
	  constrain the content of an octet string or a bit string is
	  parsed when compiling, but no further action is taken. This
	  constraint is not a PER-visible constraint.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>The subtype constraint by regular expressions (PATTERN) for character string types is parsed when compiling, but no further action is taken. This constraint is not a PER-visible constraint.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>Multiple-line comments as in C, <span class="code">/* ... */</span>, are
	  supported.</p>
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It should also be added here that the encoding formats
      supported are <strong>BER</strong>, <strong>DER</strong>, <strong>PER aligned
      basic</strong> variant and <strong>PER unaligned basic</strong> variant.</p>
    
  
  <h3><a name="id2258666">1.2 
        Getting Started with Asn1</a></h3>
    
    <h4>A First Example</h4>
      
      <p>The following example demonstrates the basic functionality used to run 
        the Erlang ASN.1 compiler.</p>
      <p>First, create a file called <span class="code">People.asn</span> containing the following:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
People DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::=
BEGIN
EXPORTS Person;
Person ::= [PRIVATE 19] SEQUENCE {
        name PrintableString,
        location INTEGER {home(0),field(1),roving(2)},
        age INTEGER OPTIONAL }
END      </pre></div>
      <p>This file (<span class="code">people.asn</span>) must be compiled before it can  be 
        used. 
        The ASN.1 compiler checks that the syntax is correct and that the 
        text represents proper ASN.1 code before generating an abstract
        syntax tree. The code-generator then uses the abstract syntax 
        tree in order to generate code.
        </p>
      <p>The generated Erlang  files will be placed in the current directory or
        in the directory specified with the <span class="code">{outdir,Dir}</span> option.
        The following shows how the compiler
        can be called from the  Erlang shell:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
1&gt;<span class="bold_code">asn1ct:compile("People",[ber_bin]).</span>
Erlang ASN.1 compiling "People.asn" 
--{generated,"People.asn1db"}--
--{generated,"People.hrl"}--
--{generated,"People.erl"}--
ok
2&gt;      </pre></div>
      <p>The ASN.1 module People is now accepted and the abstract syntax tree
        is saved in the <span class="code">People.asn1db</span> file, the
        generated Erlang code is compiled using the Erlang compiler and
        loaded into  the Erlang runtime system. Now there is a user interface
        of encode/2 and decode/2 in the module People, which is invoked by:
                <br>
<span class="code">'People':encode(&lt;Type name&gt;,&lt;Value&gt;),</span>        <br>
        or        <br>
<span class="code">'People':decode(&lt;Type name&gt;,&lt;Value&gt;),</span>        <br>
        Alternatively one can use the <span class="code">asn1rt:encode(&lt;Module name&gt; ,&lt;Type name&gt;,&lt;Value&gt;)</span> and <span class="code">asn1rt:decode(&lt; Module name&gt;,&lt;Type name&gt;,&lt;Value&gt;)</span> calls.
        However, they are not as efficient as the previous methods since they
        result in an additional <span class="code">apply/3</span> call.</p>
      <p>Assume there is a network
        application which receives instances of the  ASN.1 defined
        type Person,  modifies and sends them back again:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
receive
   {Port,{data,Bytes}} -&gt;
       case 'People':decode('Person',Bytes) of
           {ok,P} -&gt;
               {ok,Answer} = 'People':encode('Person',mk_answer(P)),
               Port ! {self(),{command,Answer}};
           {error,Reason} -&gt;
               exit({error,Reason})
       end
    end,      </pre></div>
      <p>In the example above, a  series of bytes is received from an
        external source and the bytes are then decoded into a valid
        Erlang term. This was achieved with the call
        <span class="code">'People':decode('Person',Bytes)</span> which   returned
        an Erlang value of the ASN.1 type <span class="code">Person</span>.  Then an answer was
        constructed  and encoded using
        <span class="code">'People':encode('Person',Answer)</span> which takes an
        instance of a defined ASN.1 type and transforms it to a
        (possibly) nested list of bytes  according to the BER or PER
        encoding-rules. 
                <br>
The encoder and the decoder can also be run from
        the shell. The following  dialogue with the shell illustrates
        how the functions   
        <span class="code">asn1rt:encode/3</span> and <span class="code">asn1rt:decode/3</span> are used.</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
2&gt; <span class="bold_code">Rockstar = {'Person',"Some Name",roving,50}.</span>
{'Person',"Some Name",roving,50}
3&gt; <span class="bold_code">{ok,Bytes} = asn1rt:encode('People','Person',Rockstar).</span>
{ok,[&lt;&lt;243&gt;&gt;,
     [17],
     [19,9,"Some Name"],
     [2,1,[2]],
     [2,1,"2"]]}
4&gt; <span class="bold_code">Bin = list_to_binary(Bytes).</span>
&lt;&lt;243,17,19,9,83,111,109,101,32,78,97,109,101,2,1,2,2,1,50&gt;&gt;
5&gt; <span class="bold_code">{ok,Person} = asn1rt:decode('People','Person',Bin).</span>
{ok,{'Person',"Some Name",roving,50}}
6&gt;      </pre></div>
      <p>Notice that the result from <span class="code">encode</span> is a nested list which
        must be turned into a binary before the call to <span class="code">decode</span>. A
        binary is necessary as input to decode since the module was compiled
        with the <span class="code">ber_bin</span> option
        The reason for returning a nested list is that it is faster to produce 
        and  the <span class="code">list_to_binary</span> operation is
        performed automatically when the list is sent via the Erlang port mechanism.</p>
    
    <h4>Module dependencies</h4>
      
      <p>It is common that asn1 modules import defined types, values and
        other entities from another asn1 module.</p>
      <p>Earlier versions of the asn1 compiler required that modules that
        were imported from had to be compiled before the module that
        imported. This caused problems when asn1 modules had circular
        dependencies.</p>
      <p>Now are referenced modules parsed when the compiler finds an
        entity that is imported. There will not be any code generated for
        the referenced module. However, the compiled module rely on
        that the referenced modules also will be compiled.</p>
    
  
  <h3><a name="id2254314">1.3 
        The Asn1 Application User Interface</a></h3>
    
    <p>The Asn1 application provides two separate user interfaces:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The module <span class="code">asn1ct</span> which provides the compile-time functions 
          (including the compiler).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The module <span class="code">asn1rt</span> which provides the run-time functions. 
          However, it is preferable to use the generated <span class="code">encode/2</span> and 
          <span class="code">decode/2</span> functions in each module, ie. 
          Module:encode(Type,Value), in favor of the <span class="code">asn1rt</span> 
          interface.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The reason for the division  of the interface into  compile-time 
      and  run-time 
      is that only run-time modules (<span class="code">asn1rt*</span>) need to be loaded in
      an embedded system. 
      </p>
    <h4>Compile-time Functions</h4>
      
      <p>The ASN.1 compiler can be invoked directly from the command-line
        by means of the <span class="code">erlc</span> program. This is convenient when compiling
        many ASN.1 files from the command-line or when using Makefiles.
        Here are some examples of how the <span class="code">erlc</span> command can be used to invoke the
        ASN.1 compiler:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
erlc Person.asn
erlc -bper_bin Person.asn
erlc -bber_bin +optimize ../Example.asn
erlc -o ../asnfiles -I ../asnfiles -I /usr/local/standards/asn1 Person.asn      </pre></div>
      <p>The useful options for the ASN.1 compiler are:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">-b[ber | per | ber_bin | per_bin | uper_bin]</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Choice of encoding rules, if omitted <span class="code">ber</span> is the
          default. The <span class="code">ber_bin</span> and <span class="code">per_bin</span> options
          allows for optimizations and are therefore recommended
          instaed of the <span class="code">ber</span> and <span class="code">per</span> options.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">-o OutDirectory</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Where to put the generated files, default is the current
            directory.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">-I IncludeDir</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Where to search for <span class="code">.asn1db</span> files and asn1
            source specs in order to resolve references to other
            modules. This option can be repeated many times if there
            are several places to search in.  The compiler will always
            search the current directory first.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">+compact_bit_string</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Gives the user the option to use a compact format of the BIT
            STRING type to save memory space, typing space and
            increase encode/decode performance, for details see 
            <span class="bold_code">
<a href="#BIT%20STRING">BIT STRING </a></span>type section.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">+der</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>DER encoding rule. Only when using <span class="code">-ber</span> or 
            <span class="code">-ber_bin</span> option.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">+optimize</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This flag has effect only when used together with one of
            <span class="code">per_bin</span> or <span class="code">ber_bin</span> flags. It gives time optimized
            code in the generated modules and it uses another runtime module.
            In the <span class="code">per_bin</span> case a linked-in driver is used. The
            result from an encode is a binary.</p>
          <p><strong>When this flag is used you cannot use the old format</strong><span class="code">{TypeName,Value}</span> when you encode values. Since it is
            an unnecessary construct it has been removed in favor of
            performance. It
            is neither admitted to construct SEQUENCE or SET component values
            with the format <span class="code">{ComponentName,Value}</span> since it also is
            unnecessary. The only case were it is necessary is in a CHOICE,
            were you have to pass values to the right component by specifying
            <span class="code">{ComponentName,Value}</span>. See also about
            <span class="bold_code">
<a href="#TypeNameValue">{Typename,Value}</a></span> below 
            and in the sections for each type.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">+driver</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Together with the flags <span class="code">ber_bin</span> and <span class="code">optimize</span>
            you choose to use a linked in driver for considerable faster
            decode.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">+asn1config</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This functionality works together with the flags
            <span class="code">ber_bin</span> and <span class="code">optimize</span>. You enables the
            specialized decodes, see the <span class="bold_code">
<a href="asn1_spec.html">Specialized Decode</a></span> chapter.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">+undec_rest</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A buffer that holds a message, being decoded may
            also have some following bytes. Now it is possible to get
            those following bytes returned together with the decoded
            value. If an asn1 spec is compiled with this option a tuple
            <span class="code">{ok,Value,Rest}</span> is returned. <span class="code">Rest</span> may be a
            list or a binary. Earlier versions of the compiler ignored
            those following bytes.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><span class="code">{inline,OutputName}</span></strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Compiling with this option gives one output module
            containing all asn1 run-time functionality. The asn1 specs
            are provided in a target module <span class="code">Module.set.asn</span> as
            described in the <span class="bold_code">
<a href="../../man/asn1ct.html#asn1set">reference manual</a></span>. The name of the resulting module
            containing generated encode/decode functions and inlined
            run-time functions will be <span class="code">OutputName.erl</span>. The
            merging/inlining of code is done by the <span class="code">igor</span> module
            of <span class="code">syntax_tools</span>. By default the functions generated
            from the first asn1 spec in the <span class="code">.set.asn</span> are
            exported, unless a <span class="code">{export,[atom()]}</span> or
            <span class="code">{export_all,true}</span> option are provided. The list of
            atoms are names of choosen asn1 specs from the
            <span class="code">.set.asn</span> file. See further examples of usage <span class="bold_code">

          <p>You may add any option to the Erlang compiler when

<a href="#preferred%20option%20use">Preferred Option Use</a></span> section.</p>
      <p>The compiler and other compile-time functions can also be invoked from 
        the Erlang shell. Below follows a brief
        description of the primary functions, for a
        complete description of each function see 
        <span class="bold_code">
<a href="../../man/asn1ct.html">the Asn1 Reference Manual</a></span>, the
        <span class="code">asn1ct</span> module.</p>
      <p>The compiler is invoked by using <span class="code">asn1ct:compile/1</span> with
        default options, or <span class="code">asn1ct:compile/2</span> if explicit options
        are given.
        Example:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
asn1ct:compile("H323-MESSAGES.asn1").      </pre></div>
      <p>which equals:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
asn1ct:compile("H323-MESSAGES.asn1",[ber]).      </pre></div>
      <p>If one wants PER encoding with optimizations:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
asn1ct:compile("H323-MESSAGES.asn1",[per_bin,optimize]).      </pre></div>
      <p>The generic encode and decode functions can be invoked like this:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
asn1ct:encode('H323-MESSAGES','SomeChoiceType',{call,"octetstring"}).
asn1ct:decode('H323-MESSAGES','SomeChoiceType',Bytes).      </pre></div>
      <p>Or, preferable like:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
'H323-MESSAGES':encode('SomeChoiceType',{call,"octetstring"}).
'H323-MESSAGES':decode('SomeChoiceType',Bytes).      </pre></div>

	It may not be obvious which compile options best fit a
	situation. This section describes the format of the result of
	encode and decode. It also gives some performance statistics
	when using certain options. Finally there is a recommendation
	which option combinations should be used.

	The default option is <span class="code">ber</span>. It is the same backend as
	<span class="code">ber_bin</span> except that the result of encode is transformed
	to a flat list. Below is a table that gives the different

<em>Table
        1.3:
         
        When the ASN1 linked-in driver is used.</em>
    
    <h4>Run-time Functions</h4>
      
      <p>A brief description of the major functions is given here. For a
        complete description of each function see
        <span class="bold_code">
<a href="../../man/asn1rt.html"> the Asn1 Reference Manual</a></span>, the <span class="code">asn1rt</span> module.</p>
      <p>The generic run-time encode and decode functions can be invoked as below:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
asn1rt:encode('H323-MESSAGES','SomeChoiceType',{call,"octetstring"}).
asn1rt:decode('H323-MESSAGES','SomeChoiceType',Bytes).      </pre></div>
      <p>Or, preferable like:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
'H323-MESSAGES':encode('SomeChoiceType',{call,"octetstring"}).
'H323-MESSAGES':decode('SomeChoiceType',Bytes).      </pre></div>
      <p>The asn1 linked-in driver is enabled in two occasions: encoding of
        asn1 values when the asn1 spec is compiled with <span class="code">per_bin</span> and
        <span class="code">optimize</span> or decode of encoded asn1 values when the asn1 spec is
        compiled with <span class="code">ber_bin</span>, <span class="code">optimize</span> and <span class="code">driver</span>. In
        those cases the driver will be loaded automatically at the first call
        to <span class="code">encode</span>/<span class="code">decode</span>. If one doesn't want the performance
        overhead of the driver being loaded at the first call it is possible
        to load the driver separately by <span class="code">asn1rt:load_driver()</span>.  </p>
      <p>By invoking the function <span class="code">info/0</span> in a generated module, one
        gets information about which compiler options were used.</p>
    
    <h4>Errors</h4>
      
      <p>Errors detected at
        compile time appear on the screen together with
        a line number indicating where in the source file the error 
        was detected. If no errors are found, an Erlang ASN.1 module will
        be created as default.</p>
      <p>The run-time encoders and decoders (in the <span class="code">asn1rt</span> module) do
        execute within a catch and returns <span class="code">{ok, Data}</span> or
        <span class="code">{error, {asn1, Description}}</span> where
        <span class="code">Description</span> is
        an Erlang term describing the error. </p>
    
  
  <h3><a name="id2258310">1.4 
        Multi File Compilation</a></h3>
    <a name="inlineExamples"></a>
    
    <p>There are various reasons for using a multi file compilation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You want to choose name for the generated module by
       any reason. Maybe you need to compile the same specs for
       different encoding/decoding standards.</li>
      <li>You want only one resulting module.</li>
      <li>If it is crucial to have a minimal system. Using
      <span class="code">{inline,OutputModule}</span> includes all necessary run-time
       functions of the asn1 application, but skips those modules not
       used.</li>
      <li>Upgrading issues: Even if you upgrade your Erlang system
       you may want to continue running the old asn1 run-time
       functionality.</li>
      <li>Performance issues: If you have an asn1 system with a lot
       of cross references you may gain in performance. Meassurements
       must be done for each case.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may choose either the plain multi file compilation that just
      merges the choosen asn1 specs or the <span class="code">{inline,OutputModule}</span>
      that also includes the used asn1 run-time functionality.</p>
    <p>For both cases you need to specify which asn1 specs you will
      compile in a module that must have the extension
      <span class="code">.set.asn</span>. You chose name of the module and provide the
      names of the asn1 specs. For instance, if you have the specs
      <span class="code">File1.asn</span>, <span class="code">File2.asn</span> and <span class="code">File3.asn</span> your
      module <span class="code">MyModule.set.asn</span> will look like:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
File1.asn
File2.asn
File3.asn    </pre></div>
    <p>If you compile with:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
~&gt; erlc MyModule.set.asn    </pre></div>
    <p>the result will be one merged module <span class="code">MyModule.erl</span> with
      the generated code from the three asn1 specs. But if you compile
      with:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
~&gt; erlc +"{inline,'OutputModule'}" MyModule.set.asn    </pre></div>
    <p>the result will be a module <span class="code">OutputModule.erl</span> that
      contains all encode/decode functions for the three asn1 specs and
      all used functions from the asn1 run-time modules, in this case
      <span class="code">asn1rt_ber_bin</span>. In the former case all encode/decode
      functions are exported but in the latter only the encode/decode
      functions of the first spec in the <span class="code">.set.asn</span>, i.e. those
      from <span class="code">File1.asn</span>.

        The supported ASN.1 types</em>
    <a name="TypeNameValue"></a>
    <div class="note">
<div class="label">Note</div>
<div class="content"><p>
      <p>Values of each ASN.1 type has its own representation in Erlang
        described in the following subsections. Users shall provide
        these values for encoding according to the representation, as
        in the example below.</p>
    </p></div>
</div>
    <div class="example"><pre>
Operational ::= BOOLEAN --ASN.1 definition    </pre></div>
    <p>In Erlang code it may look like:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
Val = true,
{ok,Bytes}=asn1rt:encode(MyModule,'Operational',Val),    </pre></div>
    <p>For historical reasons it is also possible to assign ASN.1 values 
      in Erlang using a tuple notation
      with type and value as this</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
Val = {'Operational',true}    </pre></div>
    <div class="warning">
<div class="label">Warning</div>
<div class="content"><p>
      <a name="warning"></a>
      <p>The tuple notation, <span class="code">{Typename, Value}</span> is only kept
        because of backward compatibility and may be withdrawn in a
        future release. If the notation is used the <span class="code">Typename</span>
        element must be spelled correctly, otherwise a run-time error
        will occur. 
        </p>
      <p>If the ASN.1 module is compiled with the flags
        <span class="code">per_bin</span> or <span class="code">ber_bin</span> and <span class="code">optimize</span> it is not
        allowed to use the tuple notation. That possibility has been
        removed due to performance reasons. Neither is it allowed to
        use the <span class="code">{ComponentName,Value}</span> notation in case of a
        SEQUENCE or SET type.</p>
    </p></div>
</div>
    <p>Below follows a description of how
      values of each type can be represented in Erlang. 
      </p>
    <h4>BOOLEAN</h4>
      <a name="BOOLEAN"></a>
      
      <p>Booleans in ASN.1  express values that can be either 
        TRUE or FALSE.
        The meanings assigned to TRUE or FALSE is beyond the scope 
        of this text.          <br>
        In ASN.1 it is possible to have:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Operational ::= BOOLEAN
      </pre></div>
      <p>Assigning a value to the type Operational in Erlang is possible by 
        using the following Erlang code:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Myvar1 = true,
      </pre></div>
      <p>Thus, in Erlang the atoms <span class="code">true</span> and <span class="code">false</span> are used
        to encode a boolean value.</p>
    
    <h4>INTEGER</h4>
      <a name="INTEGER"></a>
      
      <p>ASN.1 itself specifies indefinitely large integers, and the Erlang 
        systems with versions 4.3 and higher, support very large 
        integers, in practice indefinitely large integers.</p>
      <p>The concept of sub-typing can be applied to integers as well
        as to  other ASN.1 types. The details of sub-typing are not
        explained here, for further info see  [X.680]. A variety 
        of syntaxes are allowed when defining a  type as an integer:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
T1 ::= INTEGER
T2 ::= INTEGER (-2..7)
T3 ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)
T4 ::= INTEGER (0&lt;..MAX)
T5 ::= INTEGER (MIN&lt;..-99)
T6 ::= INTEGER {red(0),blue(1),white(2)}
      </pre></div>
      <p>The Erlang representation of an ASN.1 INTEGER is an integer or
        an atom if a so called \011<span class="code">Named NumberList</span> (see T6 above)
        is specified.</p>
      <p>Below is an example of Erlang code which assigns values for the
        above types: </p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
T1value = 0,
T2value = 6,
T6value1 = blue,
T6value2 = 0,
T6value3 = white
      </pre></div>
      <p>The Erlang variables above are now bound to valid instances of
        ASN.1 defined types. This style of value can be passed directly 
        to the encoder for transformation into a series of bytes.</p>
      <p>The decoder will return an atom if the value corresponds to a
        symbol in the Named NumberList.</p>
    
    <h4>REAL</h4>
      <a name="REAL"></a>
      
      <p>In this version reals are not implemented. When they are, 
        the following
        ASN.1 type is used:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
R1 ::= REAL
      </pre></div>
      <p>Can be assigned a value in Erlang as:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
R1value1 = 2.14,
R1value2 = {256,10,-2},
      </pre></div>
      <p>In the last line note that the tuple {256,10,-2} is the real number
        2.56 in a special notation, which will encode faster than simply 
        stating the number as 2.56. The arity three tuple is 
        <span class="code">{Mantissa,Base,Exponent}</span> i.e. Mantissa * Base^Exponent.</p>
    
    <h4>NULL</h4>
      <a name="NULL"></a>
      
      <p>Null is suitable in cases where supply and recognition of a value 
        is important but the actual value is not.</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Notype ::= NULL
      </pre></div>
      <p>The NULL type can be assigned in Erlang:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
N1 = 'NULL',
      </pre></div>
      <p>The actual value is the quoted atom 'NULL'.</p>
    
    <h4>ENUMERATED</h4>
      <a name="ENUMERATED"></a>
      
      <p>The enumerated type can be used, when the value we wish to 
        describe, may only take one of a set of predefined values.</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
DaysOfTheWeek ::= ENUMERATED { sunday(1),monday(2),tuesday(3),
\011wednesday(4),thursday(5),friday(6),saturday(7) }
      </pre></div>
      <p>For example to assign a weekday value in Erlang use the same atom
        as in the <span class="code">Enumerations</span> of the type definition:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Day1 = saturday,
      </pre></div>
      <p>The enumerated type is very similar to an integer type, when
        defined with a set of predefined values. An enumerated type
        differs from an integer in that it may only have  specified
        values, whereas an integer can also have any other value.</p>
    
    <h4>BIT STRING </h4>
      <a name="BIT%20STRING"></a>
      
      <p>The BIT STRING type can be used to model information which
        is made up of  arbitrary length series of bits. It is intended
        to be used for a selection of flags, not for binary files.        <br>
        In ASN.1 BIT STRING definitions may look like:
        </p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Bits1 ::= BIT STRING
Bits2 ::= BIT STRING {foo(0),bar(1),gnu(2),gnome(3),punk(14)}
      </pre></div>
      <p>There are four different notations available for representation of
        BIT STRING values in Erlang and as input to the encode functions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A list of binary digits (0 or 1).</li>
        <li>A hexadecimal number (or an integer). This format should be 
         avoided, since it is easy to misinterpret a <span class="code">BIT STRING</span> 
         value in this format. This format may be withdrawn in a future 
         release.</li>
        <li>A list of atoms corresponding to atoms in the <span class="code">NamedBitList</span> 
         in the BIT STRING definition.</li>
        <li>As <span class="code">{Unused,Binary}</span> where <span class="code">Unused</span> denotes how
         many trailing zero-bits 0 to 7 that are unused in the least
         significant byte in <span class="code">Binary</span>. This notation is only
         available when the ASN.1 files have been compiled with the
        <strong>+compact_bit_string</strong> flag in the option list. In
         this case it is possible to use all kinds of notation when
         encoding. But the result when decoding is always in the
         compact form. The benefit from this notation is a more
         compact notation when one has large BIT STRINGs. The
         encode/decode performance is also much better in the case of
         large BIT STRINGs. </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
<div class="label">Note</div>
<div class="content"><p>
        <p>Note that it is advised not to use the integer format of a
          BIT STRING, see the second point above.</p>
      </p></div>
</div>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Bits1Val1 = [0,1,0,1,1],
Bits1Val2 = 16#1A,
Bits1Val3 = {3,&lt;&lt;0:1,1:1,0:1,1:1,1:1,0:3&gt;&gt;}
      </pre></div>
      <p>Note that <span class="code">Bits1Val1</span>, <span class="code">Bits1Val2</span> and <span class="code">Bits1Val3</span>
        denote the same value.</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Bits2Val1 = [gnu,punk],
Bits2Val2 = 2#1110,
Bits2Val3 = [bar,gnu,gnome],
Bits2Val4 = [0,1,1,1]
      </pre></div>
      <p>The above <span class="code">Bits2Val2</span>, <span class="code">Bits2Val3</span> and <span class="code">Bits2Val4</span> 
        also all denote the same value.</p>
      <p><span class="code">Bits2Val1</span> is assigned symbolic values. The assignment means 
        that the bits corresponding to <span class="code">gnu</span> and <span class="code">punk</span> i.e. bits
        2 and 14 are set to 1 and the rest set to 0. The symbolic values
        appear as a list of values. If a named value appears, which is not
        specified in the type definition, a run-time error will occur.</p>
      <p>The compact notation equivalent to the empty BIT STRING is
        <span class="code">{0,&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;}</span>, which in the other notations is <span class="code">[]</span> or
        <span class="code">0</span>.</p>
      <p>BIT STRINGS may also be sub-typed with for example a SIZE
        specification:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Bits3 ::= BIT STRING (SIZE(0..31))      </pre></div>
      <p>This means that no bit higher than 31 can ever be set.</p>
    
    <h4>OCTET STRING</h4>
      <a name="OCTET%20STRING"></a>
      
      <p>The OCTET STRING is the simplest of all ASN.1 types The OCTET STRING
        only moves or transfers e.g. binary files or other unstructured
        information complying to two rules.
        Firstly, the bytes consist of octets and secondly, encoding is 
        not required.</p>
      <p>It is possible to have the following ASN.1 type definitions:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
O1 ::= OCTET STRING
O2 ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(28))      </pre></div>
      <p>With the following example assignments in Erlang:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
O1Val = [17,13,19,20,0,0,255,254],
O2Val = "must be exactly 28 chars....",      </pre></div>
      <p>Observe that <span class="code">O1Val</span> is assigned a series of numbers between 0 
        and 255 i.e. octets.
        <span class="code">O2Val</span> is assigned using the string notation.
        </p>
    
    <h4>Character Strings</h4>
      <a name="Character%20Strings"></a>
      
      <p>ASN.1 supports a wide variety of character sets. The main difference
        between OCTET STRINGS and the Character strings is that OCTET
        STRINGS have no imposed semantics on the bytes delivered.</p>
      <p>However, when using for instance the IA5String (which closely
        resembles ASCII)  the byte 65 (in decimal
        notation)  <strong>means</strong> the character 'A'.
        </p>
      <p>For example, if a defined type is to be a VideotexString and
        an octet is received with the unsigned integer value X, then
        the octet should be interpreted as specified in the standard
        ITU-T T.100,T.101. 
        </p>
      <p>The  ASN.1 to Erlang compiler
        will not determine the correct interpretation  of each BER  
        (Basic Encoding Rules) string octet value with different
        Character strings. Interpretation of octets is the
        responsibility of the application. Therefore, from the BER
        string point of view, octets appear to be very similar to
        character strings and are compiled in the same way.
        </p>
      <p>It should be noted that when PER (Packed Encoding Rules) is
        used, there is a significant difference in the encoding scheme 
        between OCTET STRINGS and other strings. The constraints 
        specified for a type are especially important for PER, where
        they affect the encoding.
        </p>
      <p>Please note that <strong>all</strong> the Character strings are 
        supported and it is possible to use the following ASN.1 type 
        definitions:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Digs ::= NumericString (SIZE(1..3))
TextFile ::= IA5String (SIZE(0..64000))      </pre></div>
      <p>and the following Erlang assignments:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
DigsVal1 = "456",
DigsVal2 = "123",
TextFileVal1 = "abc...xyz...",
TextFileVal2 = [88,76,55,44,99,121 .......... a lot of characters here ....]        </pre></div>
      <p>The Erlang representation for "BMPString" and
        "UniversalString" is either a list of ASCII values or a list
        of quadruples. The quadruple representation associates to the
        Unicode standard representation of characters. The ASCII
        characters are all represented by quadruples beginning with
        three zeros like {0,0,0,65} for the 'A' character. When
        decoding a value for these strings the result is a list of
        quadruples, or integers when the value is an ASCII character.
        The following example shows how it works:</p>
      <p>In a file <span class="code">PrimStrings.asn1</span> the type <span class="code">BMP</span> is defined as
                <br>
<span class="code">BMP ::= BMPString</span> then using BER encoding (<span class="code">ber_bin</span> 
        option)the input/output format will be:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
1&gt; <span class="bold_code">{ok,Bytes1} = asn1rt:encode('PrimStrings','BMP',[{0,0,53,53},{0,0,45,56}]).</span>
{ok,[30,4,"55-8"]}
2&gt; <span class="bold_code">asn1rt:decode('PrimStrings','BMP',list_to_binary(Bytes1)).</span>
{ok,[{0,0,53,53},{0,0,45,56}]}
3&gt; <span class="bold_code">{ok,Bytes2} = asn1rt:encode('PrimStrings','BMP',[{0,0,53,53},{0,0,0,65}]).</span>
{ok,[30,4,[53,53,0,65]]}
4&gt; <span class="bold_code">asn1rt:decode('PrimStrings','BMP',list_to_binary(Bytes2)).</span>
{ok,[{0,0,53,53},65]}
5&gt; <span class="bold_code">{ok,Bytes3} = asn1rt:encode('PrimStrings','BMP',"BMP string").</span>
{ok,[30,20,[0,66,0,77,0,80,0,32,0,115,0,116,0,114,0,105,0,110,0,103]]}
6&gt; <span class="bold_code">asn1rt:decode('PrimStrings','BMP',list_to_binary(Bytes3)).</span>
{ok,"BMP string"}      </pre></div>
      <p>The UTF8String is represented in Erlang as a list of integers,
        where each integer represents the unicode value of one
        character. When a value shall be encoded one first has to
        transform it to a UTF8 encoded binary, then it can be encoded by
        asn1. When decoding the result is a UTF8 encoded binary, which
        may be transformed to an integer list. The transformation
        functions, <span class="code">utf8_binary_to_list</span> and
        <span class="code">utf8_list_to_binary</span>, are in the <span class="code">asn1rt</span> module. In
        the example below we assume an asn1 definition <span class="code">UTF ::= UTF8String</span> in a module <span class="code">UTF.asn</span>:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
1&gt; <span class="bold_code">asn1ct:compile('UTF',[ber_bin]).</span>

    <h4>OBJECT IDENTIFIER</h4>
      <a name="OBJECT%20IDENTIFIER"></a>
      
      <p>The OBJECT IDENTIFIER is used whenever a unique identity is required.
        An ASN.1 module, a transfer syntax, etc. is identified with an
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER. Assume the example below:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Oid ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
      </pre></div>
      <p>Therefore, the example below is a valid Erlang instance of the 
        type 'Oid'.</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
OidVal1 = {1,2,55},
      </pre></div>
      <p>The OBJECT IDENTIFIER value is simply a tuple with the
        consecutive values which must be integers. 
        </p>
      <p>The first value is limited to the values 0, 1 or 2 and the
        second value must be in the range 0..39 when the first value
        is 0 or 1.
        </p>
      <p>The OBJECT IDENTIFIER is a very important type and it is
        widely used within different standards to uniquely identify
        various objects. In [DUBUISSON], there is an 
        easy-to-understand description of the usage of 
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER.</p>
      <p></p>
    
    <h4>Object Descriptor</h4>
      <a name="Object%20Descriptor"></a>
      
      <p>Values of this type can be assigned a value as an ordinary string i.e.        <br>
        "This is the value of an Object descriptor"</p>
    
    <h4>The TIME Types</h4>
      <a name="The%20TIME%20types"></a>
      
      <p>Two different time types are defined within ASN.1, Generalized
        Time and UTC (Universal Time Coordinated), both are assigned a
        value as an ordinary string within double quotes i.e.
        "19820102070533.8".</p>
      <p>In case of DER encoding the compiler does not check the validity
        of the time values. The DER requirements upon those strings is 
        regarded as a matter for the application to fulfill.</p>
    
    <h4>SEQUENCE</h4>
      <a name="SEQUENCE"></a>
      
      <p>The structured types of ASN.1 are constructed from other types 
        in a manner similar to the concepts of array and struct in  C.
                <br>
 A SEQUENCE in ASN.1 is
        comparable with a struct in C and a record in Erlang. 
        A SEQUENCE may be defined as:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Pdu ::= SEQUENCE {
   a INTEGER,
   b REAL,
   c OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
   d NULL }      </pre></div>
      <p>This is a 4-component structure called 'Pdu'. The major format 
        for representation of SEQUENCE in Erlang is the record format. 
        For each SEQUENCE and <span class="code">SET</span> in an ASN.1 module an Erlang 
        record declaration is generated. For <span class="code">Pdu</span> above, a record 
        like this is defined:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
-record('Pdu',{a, b, c, d}).      </pre></div>
      <p>The record declarations for a module <span class="code">M</span> are placed in a 
        separate <span class="code">M.hrl</span> file.</p>
      <p>Values can be assigned in Erlang as shown below:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
MyPdu = #'Pdu'{a=22,b=77.99,c={0,1,2,3,4},d='NULL'}.      </pre></div>
      <p>It is also possible to specify the value for each component in 
        a SEQUENCE or a SET as <span class="code">{ComponentName,Value}</span>. It is not
        recommended and is not supported if the flags <span class="code">per_bin</span> or
        <span class="code">ber_bin</span> and <span class="code">optimize</span> were used when the module was
        compiled.</p>
      <p>The decode functions will return a record as result when decoding 
        a <span class="code">SEQUENCE</span> or a <span class="code">SET</span>.
                <a name="DEFAULT"></a>
</p>
      <p>A <span class="code">SEQUENCE</span> and a <span class="code">SET</span> may contain a component with a
        <span class="code">DEFAULT</span> key word followed by the actual value that is the
        default value. In case of BER encoding it is optional to encode the
        value if it equals the default value. If the application uses the
        atom asn1_DEFAULT as value or if the value is a primitive value 
        that equals the default value the encoding omits the bytes for
        this value, which is more efficient and it results in fever 
        bytes to send to the receiving application.</p>
      <p>For instance, if the following types exists in a file "File.asn":</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Seq1 ::= SEQUENCE {
\011a  INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
\011b  Seq2 DEFAULT {aa TRUE, bb 15}
}
Seq2 ::= SEQUENCE {
\011aa BOOLEAN,
\011bb INTEGER
}
      </pre></div>
      <p>Some values and the corresponding encoding in an Erlang terminal
        is shown below:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
1&gt; <span class="bold_code">asn1ct:compile('File').</span>
Erlang ASN.1 version "1.3.2" compiling "File.asn1" 
Compiler Options: []
--{generated,"File.asn1db"}--
--{generated,"File.hrl"}--
--{generated,"File.erl"}--
ok
2&gt; <span class="bold_code">'File':encode('Seq1',{'Seq1',asn1_DEFAULT,asn1_DEFAULT}).</span>
{ok,["0",[0],[[],[]]]}
3&gt; <span class="bold_code">lists:flatten(["0",[0],[[],[]]]).</span>
[48,0]
4&gt; <span class="bold_code">'File':encode('Seq1',{'Seq1',1,{'Seq2',true,15}}).</span>
{ok,["0","\\b",[[],["\\241",[6],[[[128],[1],"\\377"],[[129],[1],[15]]]]]]}
5&gt; <span class="bold_code">lists:flatten(["0","\\b",[[],["\\241",[6],[[[128],[1],"\\377"],[[129],[1],[15]]]]]]).</span>
[48,8,161,6,128,1,255,129,1,15]
6&gt;      </pre></div>
      <p>The result after command line 3, in the example above,shows that the
        encoder omits the encoding of default values when they are specific 
        by asn1_DEFAULT. Line 5 shows that even primitive values that equals
        the default value are detected and not encoded. But the constructed
        value of component <span class="code">b</span> in <span class="code">Seq1</span> is not recognized as the
        default value. Checking of default values in <span class="code">BER</span> is not done
        in case of complex values, because it would be to expensive.
                <a name="DEFAULT%20DER"></a>
</p>
      <p>But, the DER encoding format has stronger requirements regarding 
        default\011values both for SET and SEQUENCE. A more elaborate and time 
        expensive check of default values will take place. The following is
        an example with the same types and values as above but with der 
        encoding format.</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
1&gt; <span class="bold_code">asn1ct:compile('File',[der]).</span>
Erlang ASN.1 version "1.3.2" compiling "File.asn1" 
Compiler Options: [der]
--{generated,"File.asn1db"}--
--{generated,"File.hrl"}--
--{generated,"File.erl"}--
ok
2&gt; <span class="bold_code">'File':encode('Seq1',{'Seq1',asn1_DEFAULT,asn1_DEFAULT}).</span>
{ok,["0",[0],[[],[]]]}
3&gt; <span class="bold_code">lists:flatten(["0",[0],[[],[]]]).</span>
[48,0]
4&gt; <span class="bold_code">'File':encode('Seq1',{'Seq1',1,{'Seq2',true,15}}).</span>
{ok,["0",[0],[[],[]]]}
5&gt; <span class="bold_code">lists:flatten(["0",[0],[[],[]]]).</span>
[48,0]
6&gt; 
      </pre></div>
      <p>Line 5 shows that even values of constructed types is checked and if 
        it equals the default value it will not be encoded.</p>
    
    <h4>SET</h4>
      <a name="SET"></a>
      
      <p>The SET type is an unusual construct and normally the SEQUENCE 
        type is more appropriate to use. Set is also inefficient compared with SEQUENCE, as the components can be in any order. Hence, it must be possible
        to distinguish every component in 'SET', both when
        encoding and decoding a value of a type defined to be a SET.
        The tags of all components must be different from each other
        in order to  be easily recognizable.</p>
      <p>A SET may be defined as:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Pdu2 ::= SET {
    a INTEGER,
    b BOOLEAN,
    c ENUMERATED {on(0),off(1)} }      </pre></div>
      <p>A SET is represented as an Erlang record.
        For each SEQUENCE and <span class="code">SET</span> in
        an ASN.1 module an Erlang record declaration is generated. For
        <span class="code">Pdu2</span> above a record is defined like this:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
-record('Pdu2',{a, b, c}).      </pre></div>
      <p>The record declarations for a module <span class="code">M</span> are placed in a 
        separate <span class="code">M.hrl</span> file.</p>
      <p>Values can be assigned in Erlang as demonstrated below:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
V = #'Pdu2'{a=44,b=false,c=off}.      </pre></div>
      <p>The decode functions will return a record as result when decoding 
        a SET.
        </p>
      <p>The difference between SET and SEQUENCE is that the order of
        the components (in the BER encoded format) is undefined for SET
        and defined as the lexical order from the ASN.1 definition for
        SEQUENCE. The ASN.1 compiler for Erlang will always encode a
        SET in the lexical order. The decode routines can handle SET
        components encoded in any order but will always return the
        result as a record. Since all components of the SET must be
        distinguishable both in the encoding phase as well as the
        decoding phase the following type is not allowed in a module
        with EXPLICIT or IMPLICIT as tag-default :</p>
      <p></p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Bad ::= SET {i INTEGER,
             j INTEGER }      </pre></div>
      <p>The  ASN.1 to Erlang compiler  rejects the above type. We
        shall not explain the concept of tag further here, we refer to
        [X.680].
        </p>
      <p>Encoding of a SET with components with DEFAULT values behaves
        similar as a SEQUENCE, <span class="bold_code">
<a href="#DEFAULT">see above</a></span>. The DER encoding format restrictions on DEFAULT 
        values is the same for SET as for SEQUENCE, and is supported by 
        the compiler, <span class="bold_code">
<a href="#DEFAULT%20DER">see above</a></span>.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in DER the elements of a SET will be sorted. If a 
        component is an untagged choice the sorting have to take place
        in run-time. This fact emphasizes the following recommendation
        if DER encoding format is used.</p>
      <p>The concept of SET is an unusual
        construct and one  cannot think of one single application
        where the set type is essential. (Imagine if someone
        "invented'' the shuffled array in 'C') People tend to think
        that 'SET' sounds nicer and more mathematical than 'SEQUENCE'
        and hence use it when  'SEQUENCE' would have been more
        appropriate. It is also most inefficient, since every correct
        implementation of SET must always be prepared to accept the
        components in any order. So, if possible use SEQUENCE instead
        of SET.</p>
    
    <h4>Notes about Extendability for SEQUENCE and SET</h4>
      
      <p>When a SEQUENCE or SET contains an extension marker and 
        extension components like this:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
SExt ::= SEQUENCE {
           a INTEGER,
           ...,
           b BOOLEAN }
      </pre></div>
      <p>It means that the type may get more components in newer
        versions of the ASN.1 spec. In this case it has got a new
        component <span class="code">b</span>. Thus, incoming messages that will be decoded
        may have more or fever components than this one.  
        </p>
      <p>The component <span class="code">b</span> will be treated as
        an original component when encoding a message. In this case, as
        it is not an optional element, it must be encoded.
        </p>
      <p>During decoding the <span class="code">b</span> field of the record will get the decoded 
        value of the <span class="code">b</span> 
        component if present and otherwise the value <span class="code">asn1_NOVALUE</span>.</p>
    
    <h4>CHOICE</h4>
      <a name="CHOICE"></a>
      
      <p>The CHOICE type is a space saver and is similar to the concept of a
        'union' in the C-language. As with the previous SET-type, the
        tags of all components  of a CHOICE need to be distinct. If
        AUTOMATIC TAGS are defined for the module  (which is
        preferable) the tags can be omitted completely in the ASN.1
        specification of a CHOICE.
        </p>
      <p>Assume:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
T ::= CHOICE {
        x [0] REAL,
        y [1] INTEGER,
        z [2] OBJECT IDENTIFIER }
      </pre></div>
      <p>It is then possible to assign values:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
TVal1 = {y,17},
TVal2 = {z,{0,1,2}},
      </pre></div>
      <p>A CHOICE value is  always represented as the tuple
        <span class="code">{ChoiceAlternative, Val}</span> where <span class="code">ChoiceAlternative</span>
        is an atom denoting the selected choice
        alternative.
        </p>
      <p>It is also allowed to have a CHOICE type tagged as follow:</p>
      <p></p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
C ::= [PRIVATE 111] CHOICE {
        C1,
        C2 }
C1 ::= CHOICE { 
         a [0] INTEGER,
         b [1] BOOLEAN }
C2 ::= CHOICE {
         c [2] INTEGER,
         d [3] OCTET STRING }      </pre></div>
      <p>In this case, the top type C appears to have no tags at all in
        its components, however, both C1 and C2 are also defined as
        CHOICE types and they have distinct tags among themselves.
        Hence, the above type C is both legal and allowed.
        </p>
      
        
        <p>When a CHOICE contains an extension marker and the decoder detects
          an unknown alternative of the CHIOCE the value is represented as:</p>
        <div class="example"><pre>
\011  {asn1_ExtAlt, BytesForOpenType}
        </pre></div>
        <p>Where <span class="code">BytesForOpenType</span> is a list of bytes constituting the 
          encoding of the "unknown" CHOICE alternative. </p>
      
    
    <h4>SET OF and SEQUENCE OF</h4>
      <a name="SOF"></a>
      
      <p>The SET OF and SEQUENCE OF types correspond to the concept of an array
        found in several programming languages. The Erlang syntax for
        both of these types is straight forward. For example:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Arr1 ::= SET SIZE (5) OF INTEGER (4..9) 
Arr2 ::= SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING      </pre></div>
      <p>We may have the following in Erlang:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Arr1Val = [4,5,6,7,8],
Arr2Val = ["abc",[14,34,54],"Octets"],      </pre></div>
      <p>Please note that the definition of the SET OF type implies that 
        the order of the components is undefined, but in practice there is 
        no difference between SET OF and SEQUENCE OF. The ASN.1 compiler 
        for Erlang does not randomize the order of the SET OF components 
        before encoding.</p>
      <p>However, in case of a value of the type <span class="code">SET OF</span>, the DER 
        encoding format requires the elements to be sent in ascending 
        order of their encoding, which implies an expensive sorting 
        procedure in run-time. Therefore it is strongly recommended to 
        use <span class="code">SEQUENCE OF</span> instead of <span class="code">SET OF</span> if it is possible.</p>
    
    <h4>ANY and ANY DEFINED BY</h4>
      <a name="ANY"></a>
      
      <p>The types <span class="code">ANY</span> and <span class="code">ANY DEFINED BY</span> have been removed 
        from the standard since 1994. It is recommended not to use
        these types any more. They may, however, exist in some old ASN.1
        modules.
        The idea with this type was to leave a "hole" in a definition where
        one could put unspecified data of any kind, even non ASN.1 data.</p>
      <p>A value of this type is encoded as an <span class="code">open type</span>.</p>
      <p>Instead of <span class="code">ANY</span>/<span class="code">ANY DEFINED BY</span> one should use
        <span class="code">information object class</span>, <span class="code">table constraints</span> and
        <span class="code">parameterization</span>. In particular the construct
        <span class="code">TYPE-IDENTIFIER.@Type</span> accomplish the same as the
        deprecated <span class="code">ANY</span>.</p>
      <p>See also <span class="bold_code">
<a href="#Information%20Object">Information object</a></span></p>
    
    <h4>EXTERNAL, EMBEDDED PDV and CHARACTER STRING</h4>
      <a name="NegotiationTypes"></a>
      
      <p>These types are used in presentation layer negotiation. They are
        encoded according to their associated type, see [X.680].</p>
      <p>The <span class="code">EXTERNAL</span> type had a slightly different associated type
        before 1994. [X.691] states that encoding shall follow
        the older associate type. Therefore does generated encode/decode
        functions convert values of the newer format to the older format
        before encoding. This implies that it is allowed to use 
        <span class="code">EXTERNAL</span> type values of either format for encoding. Decoded
        values are always returned on the newer format.</p>
    
    <h4>Embedded Named Types</h4>
      
      <p>The structured types previously described may very well have other named types
        as their components. The general syntax to assign a value to the component C
        of a named ASN.1 type T in Erlang is the record syntax
        <span class="code">#'T'{'C'=Value}</span>. 
        Where <span class="code">Value</span> may be a value of yet another type T2.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
B ::= SEQUENCE {
        a Arr1,
        b [0] T }
Arr1 ::= SET SIZE (5) OF INTEGER (4..9) 
T ::= CHOICE {
        x [0] REAL,
        y [1] INTEGER,
        z [2] OBJECT IDENTIFIER }      </pre></div>
      <p>The above example can be assigned like this in Erlang:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
V2 = #'B'{a=[4,5,6,7,8], b={x,7.77}}.
      </pre></div>
    
  
  <h3><a name="id2267049">1.6 
        Naming of Records in .hrl Files</a></h3>
    
    <p>When an asn1 specification is compiled all defined types of
      type SET or SEQUENCE will result in a corresponding record in the
      generated hrl file. This is because the values for SET/SEQUENCE
      as mentioned in sections above are represented as records.</p>
    <p>Though there are some special cases of this functionality that
      are presented below.</p>
    <h4>Embedded Structured Types</h4>
      
      <p>It is also possible in ASN.1 to have components that are  themselves
        structured types.
        For example, it is possible to have:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Emb ::= SEQUENCE {
    a SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING,
    b SET {
       a [0] INTEGER,
       b [1] INTEGER DEFAULT 66},
    c CHOICE {
       a INTEGER,
       b FooType } }
FooType ::= [3] VisibleString      </pre></div>
      <p>The following records are generated because of the type <span class="code">Emb</span>:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
-record('Emb,{a, b, c}).
-record('Emb_b',{a, b = asn1_DEFAULT}). % the embedded SET type
      </pre></div>
      <p>Values of the <span class="code">Emb</span> type can be assigned like this:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
V = #'Emb'{a=["qqqq",[1,2,255]], 
           b = #'Emb_b'{a=99}, 
           c ={b,"Can you see this"}}.
      </pre></div>
      <p>For an embedded type of type SEQUENCE/SET in a SEQUENCE/SET
        the record name is extended with an underscore and the component
        name. If the embedded structure is deeper with SEQUENCE, SET or
        CHOICE types in the line, each component-/alternative-name will
        be added to the recordname.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Seq ::= SEQUENCE{
    a\011CHOICE{
\011b SEQUENCE {
\011   c  INTEGER
\011   }
\011}
}      </pre></div>
      <p>will result in the following record:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
-record('Seq_a_b',{c}).      </pre></div>
      <p>If the structured type has a component with an embedded
        SEQUENCE OF/SET OF which embedded type in turn is a
        SEQUENCE/SET it will give a record with the SEQOF/SETOF
        addition as in the following example:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Seq ::= SEQUENCE {
    a SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
\011       b
               }
    c SET OF SEQUENCE {
\011       d
               }
}      </pre></div>
      <p>This results in the records:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
-record('Seq_a_SEQOF'{b}).
-record('Seq_c_SETOF'{d}).      </pre></div>
      <p>A parameterized type should be considered as an embedded
        type. Each time a such type is referenced an instance of it is
        defined. Thus in the following example a record with name
        <span class="code">'Seq_b'</span> is generated in the .hrl file and used to hold
        values.</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Seq ::= SEQUENCE {
    b PType{INTEGER}
}
PType{T} ::= SEQUENCE{
    id T
}      </pre></div>
    
    <h4>Recursive Types</h4>
      
      <p>Types may refer to themselves. Suppose:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
Rec ::= CHOICE {
     nothing [0] NULL,
     something SEQUENCE {
          a INTEGER,
          b OCTET STRING,
          c Rec }}      </pre></div>
      <p>This type is recursive; that is, it refers to itself. This is allowed 
        in ASN.1 and the  ASN.1-to-Erlang compiler  supports this recursive
        type. A value for this type is assigned in Erlang as shown below:</p>
      <div class="example"><pre>
V = {something,#'Rec_something'{a = 77, 
                                b = "some octets here", 
                                c = {nothing,'NULL'}}}.      </pre></div>
    
  
  <h3><a name="id2267216">1.7 
        ASN.1 Values</a></h3>
    
    <p>Values can be assigned to ASN.1 type within the ASN.1 code
      itself, as opposed to the actions taken in the previous chapter where
      a value was assigned to an ASN.1 type in Erlang. The full value
      syntax of ASN.1 is supported and [X.680] describes in detail how
      to assign values in ASN.1. Below is a short example:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
TT ::= SEQUENCE {
   a INTEGER,
   b SET OF OCTET STRING }
tt TT ::= {a 77,b {"kalle","kula"}}    </pre></div>
    <p>The value defined here could be used in several ways. 
      Firstly, it could be used as the value in some DEFAULT component:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
SS ::= SET {
    s [0] OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
    val TT DEFAULT tt }    </pre></div>
    <p>It could also be used from inside an Erlang program. If the above ASN.1
      code was defined in ASN.1 module <span class="code">Values</span>, then the ASN.1 value
      <span class="code">tt</span> can be reached from Erlang as
      a function call to <span class="code">'Values':tt()</span> as in the example below.</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
1&gt; <span class="bold_code">Val = 'Values':tt().</span>
{'TT',77,["kalle","kula"]}
2&gt; <span class="bold_code">{ok,Bytes} = 'Values':encode('TT',Val).</span>
{ok,["0",
     [18],
     [[[128],[1],"M"],["\\241","\\r",[[[4],[5],"kalle"],[[4],[4],"kula"]]]]]}
3&gt; <span class="bold_code">FlatBytes = lists:flatten(Bytes).</span>
[48,18,128,1,77,161,13,4,5,107,97,108,108,101,4,4,107,117,108,97]
4&gt; <span class="bold_code">'Values':decode('TT',FlatBytes).</span>
{ok,{'TT',77,["kalle","kula"]}}
5&gt;
    </pre></div>
    <p>The above example shows that a function is generated by the compiler 
      that returns a valid Erlang representation of the value, even though
      the value is of a complex type.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is a macro generated for each value in the .hrl 
      file. So, the defined value <span class="code">tt</span> can also be extracted by 
      <span class="code">?tt</span> in application code.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="id2267311">1.8 
        Macros</a></h3>
    
    <p>MACRO is not supported as the the type is no longer part of the 
      ASN.1 standard.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="id2267329">1.9 
        ASN.1 Information Objects (X.681)</a></h3>
    <a name="Information%20Object"></a>
    
    <p>Information Object Classes, Information Objects and Information
      Object Sets, (in the following called classes, objects and
      object sets respectively), are defined in the standard
      definition [X.681]. In the following only a brief
      explanation is given. </p>
    <p>These constructs makes it possible to define open types,
      i.e. values of that type can be of any ASN.1 type. It is also
      possible to define relationships between different types and
      values, since classes can hold types, values, objects, object
      sets and other classes in its fields.
      An Information Object Class may be defined in ASN.1 as:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= CLASS {
      &amp;Message,
      &amp;Reply               OPTIONAL,
      &amp;Error               OPTIONAL,
      &amp;id          PrintableString UNIQUE
}
WITH SYNTAX {
      NEW MESSAGE     &amp;Message
      [REPLY           &amp;Reply]
      [ERROR           &amp;Error]
      ADDRESS          &amp;id
}    </pre></div>
    <p>An object is an instance of a class and an object set is a set
      containing objects of one specified class. A definition may look like
      below.</p>
    <p>The object <span class="code">object1</span> is an instance of the CLASS 
      GENERAL-PROCEDURE and has one type field and one fixed type value 
      field. The object <span class="code">object2</span> also has an OPTIONAL field ERROR,
      which is a type field.</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
object1 GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {
    NEW MESSAGE      PrintableString
    ADDRESS          "home"
}
object2 GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {
    NEW MESSAGE INTEGER
    ERROR INTEGER
    ADDRESS "remote"
}    </pre></div>
    <p>The field ADDRESS is a UNIQUE field. Objects in an object set must
      have unique values in their UNIQUE field, as in GENERAL-PROCEDURES: </p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
GENERAL-PROCEDURES GENERAL-PROCEDURE ::= {
    object1 | object2}    </pre></div>
    <p>One can not encode a class, object or object set, only referring to
      it when defining other ASN.1 entities. Typically one refers to a
      class and to object sets by table constraints and component
      relation constraints [X.682] in ASN.1 types, as in: </p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
StartMessage  ::= SEQUENCE {
    msgId  GENERAL-PROCEDURE.&amp;id  ({GENERAL-PROCEDURES}),
    content GENERAL-PROCEDURE.&amp;Message\011({GENERAL-PROCEDURES}{@msgId}),
    }    </pre></div>
    <p>In the type <span class="code">StartMessage</span> the constraint following the
      <span class="code">content</span> field tells that in a value of type
      <span class="code">StartMessage</span> the value in the <span class="code">content</span> field must
      come from the same object that is choosen by the <span class="code">msgId</span>
      field.</p>
    <p>So, the value <span class="code">#'StartMessage'{msgId="home",content="Any Printable String"}</span> is legal to encode as a StartMessage
      value, while the value <span class="code">#'StartMessage'{msgId="remote", content="Some String"}</span> is illegal since the constraint
      in StartMessage tells that when you have choosen a value from a 
      specific object in the object set GENERAL-PROCEDURES in the 
      msgId field you have to choose a value from that same object in
      the content field too. In this second case it should have been 
      any INTEGER value.</p>
    <p><span class="code">StartMessage</span> can in the <span class="code">content</span> field be
      encoded with a value of any type that an object in the
      <span class="code">GENERAL-PROCEDURES</span> object set has in its <span class="code">NEW MESSAGE</span> field. This field refers to a type field
      <span class="code">&amp;amp;Message</span> in the class. The <span class="code">msgId</span> field is always
      encoded as a PrintableString, since the field refers to a fixed type
      in the class.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="id2267498">1.10 
        Parameterization (X.683)</a></h3>
    
    <p>Parameterization, which is defined in the standard [X.683], can be used when defining types, values, value
      sets, information object classes, information objects or
      information object sets. 
      A part of a definition can be supplied as a parameter. For
      instance, if a Type is used in a definition with certain
      purpose, one want the typename to express the intention. This
      can be done with parameterization.</p>
    <p>When many types (or an other ASN.1 entity) only differs in some
      minor cases, but the structure of the types are similar, only
      one general type can be defined and the differences may be supplied
      through parameters. </p>
    <p>One example of use of parameterization is:</p>
    <div class="example"><pre>
General{Type} ::= SEQUENCE
{
     number     INTEGER,
     string     Type
}
      
T1 ::= General{PrintableString}
T2 ::= General{BIT STRING}
    </pre></div>
    <p>An example of a value that can be encoded as type T1 is {12,"hello"}.</p>
    <p>Observe that the compiler not generates encode/decode functions for
      parameterized types, only for the instances of the parameterized 
      types. So, if a file contains the types General{}, T1 and T2 above,
      encode/decode functions will only be generated for T1 and T2.
      </p>
  
  <h3><a name="id2267553">1.11 
        Tags</a></h3>
    
    <p>Every built-in ASN.1 type, except CHOICE and ANY have a universal tag.
      This is a unique number that clearly identifies the type.      <br>
 
      It is essential for all users of ASN.1  to
      understand  all the details about tags.</p>
    <p>Tags are implicitly encoded in the BER encoding as shown below, but 
      are hardly not accounted for in the PER encoding. In PER tags are
      used for instance to sort the components of a SET.</p>
    <p>There are four different types of tags.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong><strong>universal</strong></strong></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>For types whose meaning is the same in all 
          applications. Such as integers, sequences and so on; that is, all the built in
          types.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong><strong>application</strong></strong></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>For application specific types for example, the types in
          X.400 Message handling service have this sort of tag.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong><strong>private</strong></strong></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>For your own private types.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong><strong>context</strong></strong></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This is used to distinguish otherwise indistinguishable
          types in a specific context. For example, if we have two
          components of a 
          CHOICE type that are both <span class="code">INTEGER</span> values, there is no
          way for the decoder to 
          decipher which component was actually chosen, since both
          components will be
          tagged as <span class="code">INTEGER</span>. When this or similar situations occur,  
          one or both of the components should be given a  context specific
          to resolve the ambiguity.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The tag in the case of the 'Apdu' type [PRIVATE 1] is encoded to a
      sequence of bytes  making it possible for  a
      decoder to  look at the (initial) bytes that arrive and determine
      whether the rest of the bytes  must be of the type associated
      with that particular sequence of bytes.  This means that each
      tag must be uniquely associated with <strong>only</strong> one  ASN.1
      type.
      </p>
    <p>Immediately following the tag is a sequence of bytes
      informing the  decoder of the length of the instance. This is
      sometimes referred to  as TLV  (Tag length value) encoding.
      Hence, the structure of a BER encoded series of bytes is as shown in the table below.</p>
    <p></p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr>
        <td align="left" valign="middle">Tag</td>
        <td align="left" valign="middle">Len</td>

  <h3><a name="id2267717">1.12 
        Encoding Rules</a></h3>
    
    <p>When the first recommendation on ASN.1 was released 1988 it was
      accompanied with the Basic Encoding Rules, BER, as the only 
      alternative for encoding.
      BER is a somewhat verbose protocol. It adopts a so-called TLV (type, 
      length, value) approach to encoding in which every element of the 
      encoding carries some type information, some length information and 
      then the value of that element. Where the element is itself 
      structured, then the Value part of the element is itself a series of 
      embedded TLV components, to whatever depth is necessary. In summary, 
      BER is not a compact encoding but is relatively fast and easy to 
      produce.</p>
    <p>The DER (Distinguished Encoding Rule) encoding format was included in
      the standard in 1994. It is a specialized form of BER, which gives 
      the encoder the option to encode some entities differently. For
      instance, is the value for TRUE any octet with any bit set to one. But,
      DER does not leave any such choices. The value for TRUE in the DER 
      case is encoded as the octet <span class="code">11111111</span>. So, the same value 
      encoded by two different DER encoders must result in the same bit 
      stream.</p>
    <p>A more compact encoding is achieved with the Packed Encoding
    Rules PER which was introduced together with the revised
    recommendation in 1994. PER takes a rather different approach from
    that taken by BER. The first difference is that the tag part in
    the TLV is omitted from the encodings, and any tags in the
    notation are not encoded. The potential ambiguities are resolved
    as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A CHOICE is encoded by first encoding a choice index which
          identifies the chosen
          alternative by its position in the notation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The elements of a SEQUENCE are transmitted in textual
        order. OPTIONAL or DEFAULT elements are preceded by a bit map
        to identify which elements are present. After sorting the
        elements of a SET in the "canonical tag order" as defined in
        X.680 8.6 they are treated as a SEQUENCE regarding OPTIONAL
        and DEFAULT elements. A SET is transferred in the sorted
        order.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A second difference is that PER takes full account of the sub-typing
      information in that the encoded bytes are affected by the constraints.
      The BER encoded bytes are unaffected by the constraints.
      PER uses the sub-typing information to for example omit length fields 
      whenever possible. </p>
    <p>The run-time functions, sometimes take the constraints into account
      both for BER and PER. For instance are SIZE constrained strings checked.</p>
    <p>There are two variants of PER, <strong>aligned</strong> and <strong>unaligned</strong>.
      In summary, PER results in compact encodings which require much more
      computation to produce than  BER.
